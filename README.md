## Project Overview

The purpose of this NFT ARTWORK Auction project is to create a decentralized auction in Solidity.

Our motivation is to build and develop a blockchain based Auction Artwork marketplace using the decentralized Ethereum platform. Art houses like OpenSea and other NFT sites can no longer be ignored both from a financial impact, the revolutionary nature of NFTs and the revenue that rivals traditional auction houses like Christies. 

This project utilizes the blockchain and the idea of an non-fungible token to create a fresh new approach to auctioning off artwork. Users who are part of the Ethereum community can utilize their ETH to bid on artwork and be part of an artistic and computing wave that is taking the world by storm.

## Relevance to Fintech 

### Ethereum and the Decentralized Apps:

Ethereum is a blockchain platform, and as such is a shared, immutable ledger that simplifies recording transactions and tracking assets in a peer to peer network. In traditional apps the backend or database data is hosted on a server or static data structure like a server. An ethereum blockchain does store data, but utilizes a distributed system where each member node is not solely responsible for hosting the entire infrastructure. Blockchain technology is built specifically for recording transactions and would make it easier for companies to track things like auction purchases, Artwork ID numbers and utilizes tokens which assist in facilitating our project goals. 

### Smart Contracts and Solidity: 

Solidity and Smart Contracts are currently emerging but will spread in both popularity and utility. Auctions, gaming and cryptocurrencies are just the beginning. Smart Contracts represent a decentralized backend functionality that calls variables, methods and interacts with hosting platforms like the Pinata IPFS. They leverage technologies like tokenization, consensus mechanism and Ethereum wallets to provide financial transactions, distributed storage and much more. 

### Auctions and Dapp Auctions: 

An auction is a classic financial instrument, but the decentralized web allows for a new representation of an older concept. In the form of a blockchain, an auction can be spread amongst members of a network, in this case we utilize the Ethereum network. 

To translate auctions into the spirit of openness and decentralization that Blockchain empowered, Dapp Auctions brign together all of the aspects of auctions and Blockchan capabilities and features; based on the Ethereum network and using open sourced technical solutions, we tried to build an ambitious platform that allows both creators and investors to sell and invest in original NFT and artworks, all with Ether.

## Conclusions section 

Blockchain technology is well-suited to Auctions because it is built specifically for recording transactions  like auction purchases, Artwork ID numbers and utilizes tokens which assisted in facilitating our project goals.

Users who are part of the Ethereum community can utilize their ETH to bid on artwork and be part of an artistic and computing wave that is taking the world by storm.

Solidity and Smart Contracts are currently emerging but will spread in both popularity and utility. Our team believes that Auctions, gaming and cryptocurrencies are just the beginning.
